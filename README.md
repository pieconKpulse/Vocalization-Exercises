However, singing is a physically demanding activity. It requires a lot of energy, strength, and stamina, which must be cultivated over time. As with any physical activity, singers must warm-up before performing to achieve their fullest potential and reduce the chances of injury.
 
There are countless warm-up exercises that singers can perform to strengthen and protect their voices. This post will introduce you to the top twelve vocal warm-up exercises and other techniques that singers should know to keep their instruments healthy and strong.
 
Vocal warm-up exercises strengthen the voice, develop breath control, and minimize the risk of injury. Even world-famous singers like Beyonc and Adele perform vocal exercises to keep their vocal muscles strong and flexible.

Humming is one of the best all-around vocal warm-ups and one of the easiest. It can loosen up vocal cords, improve breathing, and strengthen the voice before singing. Humming also develops tone quality and pitch control.
 
Humming before rehearsals or performances will not only warm up your voice but also clear your mind and relieve tension in your body. In fact, according to a recent brain image study, humming can even lower cortisol levels (a stress hormone) and reduce symptoms of depression.
 
Lip trills are an excellent warm-up tool that loosens up the throat and strengthens the facial muscles used when singing. This exercise is often used to warm up the voice before belting exercises and higher range passages. It also releases tension in the jaw and tongue, which helps with breath control.
 
As you begin to feel comfortable with this exercise, try to add a hum to the trill. This will give your voice a richer tone and vibrato. You can also try to change the pitch with each trill, going up and down the scale.
 
This exercise has you buzzing your lips as if playing a double-reed instrument. It helps with airflow, proper vocal cord position, and seal and builds up strength in the jaw and facial muscles for clear tone production.
 
The key to mastering this exercise is to turn any distractions off and focus on what you are saying. First, run through the tongue twister at a moderate speed. Then, speed up the tempo as much as you can before the tongue trips over itself. This will help you develop your articulation skills.
 
Stretching out these sounds with a vowel warm-up exercise can relieve mouth tension while warming up your voice and preparing you for any demanding performances. This exercise is also a great way to improve breath support.
 
Jaw tension is often the cause of throat and mouth tension in singers. However, vocal exercises that loosen your jaw before singing will open your throat and minimize the possibility of strain or discomfort during a performance.
 
This is a fantastic exercise for vocalists who are just starting as it will keep the jaw relaxed while practicing singing techniques for the first time. Although this exercise may feel strange to perform at first, it will soon become second nature with regular practice.
 
This exercise is great for warming up the voice by exercising all parts of the vocal register. It also helps you memorize scales and practice vocal accuracy. You can also speed it up over time to develop your breath control and agility.
 
A yawn or sigh is the perfect example of how our body naturally opens the throat, mouth, and jaw to achieve full resonance. This exercise mimics that motion and relieves stress from vocal muscles before singing.
 
This warm-up vocal exercise is a fantastic way to condition the vocal cords for higher-range singing. It also helps develop proper airflow into the vocal instrument while strengthening your voice and opening your throat.
 
This exercise is a great way to wake up your voice before singing, especially if you feel yourself vocalizing too much in your throat or jaw. It builds the balance of air support and resonance needed to produce a healthy sound when singing high notes.
 
Continue practicing this exercise until you can maintain the air support and sound projection with ease. Maintaining proper airflow before singing is essential for vocal development, so this exercise is a must-know for both new and advanced singers.
 
Vocal warm-up exercises should become part of your routine. Just like practicing scales on your instrument, performing vocal warm-ups every day will boost your voice control and well-being. The more you perform these exercises, the better your vocal delivery will be in any performance setting.
 
Repetition is the key to mastering these techniques. Practice vocal exercises before each rehearsal, performance, or practice session. In time, you will see your voice projecting with ease and gaining new power.
 
To master these exercises, it may prove helpful to take singing lessons. Trained vocalist instructors can help you learn the proper techniques and form to succeed in your vocal performance. They will also offer you valuable insight into how your unique voice works, which can help you understand and execute these exercises with ease.
 
The cool-down process allows you to gradually decrease the air you use by replacing full breaths with short gasps. It also gives you a chance to practice your vocal exercises without feeling too worn out from performing.
 
Unfinished sounds can be particularly useful when used correctly. These exercises can make specific tasks such as extending range or finding balance through difficult vocal transitions much more accessible.
 
As I was going in and out as I had this fever that lasted for days, as I kind of going in and out of this fitful sleep, I somehow figured that I was dying, and felt the need to give myself a grade on my life until this point. What I do remember from that is I gave myself a soft B-/hard C+.
 
So as we begin the singing journey, part of the process is to make the process of singing easier, the active singing easier. And one of the harder things that we have to do is to get ourselves balanced in vocal registration.

I'm an engineer by trade and I like to sing as a hobby. But I'm unsatisfied with my voice and would like to make some foundational improvements. However, I am not a committed enough to pursue private lessons.
 
My drive to work is about 20min, which I usually waste listening to the radio. It doesn't take any commitment to convert one of those drives to a vocal exercise session. I thought it would be a good idea to come up with a exercise routine.
 
These vocal exercises are fairly straightforward and Eric explains them very well. Are there anything else I can add to my exercises(or things to be changed)? Am I at least somewhat effectively using my time? I realize that gains can be made more quickly with a private teacher, but I am not losing anything doing this.
 
It's a great idea. I know several vocalists who learn new songs this way. So far none has crashed. Backing tracks are readily available, and keys can be specified/changed. Make the second half of your commute into time for this, after you've warmed up. Any exercises will do, from scales and arpeggios to making strange noises which will develop your vocal muscles.. For improving your timing, sing along with a track, and turn the volume down for, say, 10 secs or so, see if you're still with the track. While you're at it, you might as well record what you're doing, for analysis later.
 
Like most ALS patients, my symptoms began in my lower legs and feet and then later affected my speech and swallowing. I immediately cobbled together an at-home regimen of therapy that expanded on the techniques I had learned in a program called Living Speech Series. These included daily diaphragmatic breathing exercises and a voice study to practice specific conversation skills.

Last clinic visit I mentioned the Living Speech Series to the speech pathologist as I'd read your article on it and that your SP was interested and supportive since they've offered me nothing and I feel like it can't hurt plus helps me mentally to feel proactive as my speech was first indication and at 71 when I started this journey 6 years ago first thing they looked at was TIA's due to family history and CAD with heart attack in 2008. The SP at my clinic said waste of money after briefly scanning webpage, waste of money was the tobii dynavox that's so cumbersome and slow I use it for tablet but doesn't interface with my iPhone or have current windows programs! I appreciate your research and information on this and other topics, still considering trying if for no other reason than I love to sing. Parkinson info always good, originally diagnosed with Parkinson's syndrome so joined local group and participated in their exercise program at local Y 5 days a week, amazing programs, miss them and the people! Thanks Chris
 
I believe the study I wrote about is another indication that yes, there are vocal skills we can use and, yes, many of us are motivated to do them. If she will not teach you these simple vocal skills (that all SPL know) then practice them on your own: change chest breathing to diaphragm breathing, adjust to a lower pitch, move consonants to the front of the mouth, and hum or sing (saying more words with each exhale).
